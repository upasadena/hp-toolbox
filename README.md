## ðŸ’¿ Install

Set up your project using your preferred package manager. Use the corresponding command to install the dependencies:

`pnpm install`

After completing the installation, your environment is ready for Vuetify development.

## ðŸ’¡ Usage

This section covers how to start the development server and build your project for production.

### Starting the Development Server

To start the development server with hot-reload, run the following command. The server will be accessible at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000):

```bash
pnpm dev --host
```

> Add NODE_OPTIONS='--no-warnings' to suppress the JSON import warnings that happen as part of the Vuetify import mapping. If you are on Node [v21.3.0](https://nodejs.org/en/blog/release/v21.3.0) or higher, you can change this to NODE_OPTIONS='--disable-warning=5401'. If you don't mind the warning, you can remove this from your package.json dev script.

### Building for Production

To build your project for production, use:

```bash
pnpm build
```

Once the build process is completed, your application will be ready for deployment in a production environment.
